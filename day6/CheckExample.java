/*
 * 
 * Write a Java program to illustrate the method returning an objects by getting details from user and check the type of objects using instanceof and display these details in a detailed view using the following classes and methods.
[Note :
Strictly adhere to the object oriented specifications given as a part of the problem statement.
Follow the naming conventions as mentioned. Create separate classes in separate files.]

Create a class named Rectangle with the following private member variables / attributes.
Data Type Variable
Int length
Int width

Include appropriate getters and setters.
Include 2 argument constructor. The order in which the argument should be passed is Rectangle(int length, int width)

In the Rectangle class include the following methods.
Method Description
int area( ) This method computes the area of the rectange and returns it.
void display( ) This method displays the length and width of the rectangle. Display the statement ‘Rectangle Dimension’ inside this method and also print the dimensions.
Rectangle dimensionChange(int d) This method changes the rectangle dimension by increasing the length and width of the rectangle by d times.

Create an another class Main and write a main() method to test the above class.

In the main( ) method, read the length and width details from the user and test the above methods. Display the area of the rectange inside the main() method.

Problem Constraints:
1. Use instanceof operator to check the object returned by dimensionChange( ) method.
[The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).]

Input and Output Format:
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

Sample Input and Output 1:
Enter the length of the rectangle
5
Enter the width of the rectangle
6
Rectangle Dimension
Length:5
Width:6
Area of the Rectangle:30
Enter the new dimension
2
Rectangle Dimension
Length:10
Width:12
Area of the Rectangle:120
